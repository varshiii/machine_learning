### üìö Machine Learning Notes Repository
## üöÄ Overview
Welcome to my Machine Learning Notes repository! This space is dedicated to consolidating key concepts, algorithms, and best practices in the field of machine learning. Whether you're just getting started or looking to deepen your understanding, these notes will serve as a valuable resource. Topics range from foundational concepts to advanced techniques, including hands-on code examples.

## üìù Topics Covered
Here‚Äôs a list of topics covered in this repository:
1. Data Preprocessing
2. Classifying Iris Species
3. MNIST
4. Machine Learning Notes
   - Definition and key concepts
   - Types of machine learning (Supervised, Unsupervised, Reinforcement Learning)
5. Regression code
   - This folder contains various Regression Models implemented using Python and popular machine learning libraries. The models are built to predict continuous outcomes based on different datasets. The project includes the following regression models:
        - Linear Regression
        - Multiple Linear Regression
        - Polynomial Regression
        - Lasso and Ridge Regression
        - Support Vector Regression (SVR)
    - Each model is built on specific datasets to showcase the unique features and use cases of different regression techniques.
6. Classification code
      - This folder contains the implementation of various Classification Models using Python and popular machine learning libraries. These models are designed to classify data into distinct categories based on the features provided. In this project, the models are built and tested using the Social_Network_Ads dataset to demonstrate the predictive power of different classification algorithms. The project includes the following Classification models:
         - Logistic Regression
         - KNN
         - SVM
         - SVM Kernel
7. Clustering Code
      - This folder contains the implementation of various Clustering Models using Python. These unsupervised learning techniques are designed to group data points based on similarities in their features without any labeled outputs. In this project, the models are applied to the Mall Customers dataset. Clustering Models i used are:
         - Hierarchical Clustering
         - K-Means Clustering
         - Silhouette Analysis
8. CrossValidation Method Types
      - This folder contains various Cross-Validation techniques applied to a cancer dataset for model evaluation. Cross-validation is essential for validating the generalizability of machine learning models and ensuring that they perform well on unseen data. In this project, different types of cross-validation methods are implemented to assess model performance.
